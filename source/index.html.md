# Introduction

Order Desk provides an API for programatic access to your store’s data.The Order Desk API is a RESTful API that accepts and returns JSON. You can use the API to pull order status, add orders, add shipments, and retrieve inventory items.


<<<<<<< HEAD:source/index.md
=======
This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

## API Usage and Availability

While we endeavor to ensure that the API has 100% uptime, the API access should not be assumed. It’s best to connect to the Order Desk API in a background process on your end and not through a customer-facing interface. For example, don’t import orders into Order Desk and then wait for a response as part of your shopping cart’s order flow. A better method would be to import orders into your order system and then set up a cron job on your end to attempt to import these orders into the Order Desk API in an asynchronous process.

## PHP Client
=======
api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
